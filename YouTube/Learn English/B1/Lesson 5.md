but in this case there's something, something that i can't explain, u know, when you're doing something that nobody wants to do, when you're getting up so early, than nobody can't, when you're working more than anybody, when you're dreaming more than somebody, it's a very good vibe, but it's NOT easy, it's a hard way, but it's the most effective ways to take your dream, u should realize that u will lose a lot of friends, parties, chill, u will working every day, NO DAYS OFF it will be your second name, sometime u will fell loneliness, sometime u will be sad, sometime u will be upset, but u must go through these difficulties and take YOUR dream!
