## Composition: 

So, i going to make composition for some theme right now, i know that it's maybe typical of somebody, but i think it's a very good exercise for improving English's skills. 

My today theme is Motivation 

Yeah, it's my favorite theme, because motivation is closely related to our life, even u're going to take a cup of coffee - it's motivation to do something. 

But some people just don't use this kind of a very big skill, they just prefer to take an easily dopamine and that's all what they wanna do - and I'm strongly believe that EVERYBODY can change it's life, because motivation isn't just coffee it's a very big wave, u just need to take it under of your control. 

And i wanna to tell u my story, this story is about guy that has just dream and nothing more, he don't have a reach parents, he just have a dream, clearly view of his life and iron will and he don't know anything except win. 

He was born in Tashkent, his parents were ordinary middle class residents, he couldn't take to study in a high school, but he believed that he can change the world, he was always saying: "I will change this world, push my self to the dream and nothing more", 
for some people this kind of life style seems very crazy, especially if they're accustomed to living in normal life style, but this story isn't about "normal" life.
