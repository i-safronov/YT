hmmm, how to say that, i wanna to say "Just be stronger",

u know, every day, especially for me, it's like a fight, even u're getting up at 5:00 am, when nobody will do this in a clear mind, u're felling like a crazy guy, and it's not even easy, u're felling like a beaten up human, and the bad seems too much attractive, but you're going out of this comfort zone, and going to the fight for your dream.

every day u're feeling alone, when it's summer and everybody going to the beach, parks and taking fun time, u're studying every minute, with believe that it will pay off, it's not easy, and not for a weak people, but u can do it differently, because you're fighter, and even u're felling that u're going lose, u will say "Just watch me how I will touch the star". 

u were alone guy, u were crazy, everybody laughed at you, but: 

at the beginning they do not notice you, then they laugh at you, then fight with you, then u will win!!!
