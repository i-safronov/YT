good evening, reader of this title! 

today was a pritty productivity day, i was learning, working, learning and training, it was a typical day,  but something today was different, my teammates thinking to go to make a holiday in the country house, and i had thought that i will not go with them, but in some moment, i was thinking, "why not?", i wrote some pluses to go with them and some minuses and decided to go with them, because i will take so many pluses than i won't go.
