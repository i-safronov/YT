yay, sup. 

i think that u're aware of my normal productive day, i doing the tasks step by step, finished some tasks at work, and i think that i need a plan what i should do at work, because i have a normal task, and it's not decompose, it's just a list of features what i need to do, and nothing more =(, btw i'm not angry about that. 

so, i wanna to make name of today's talk - your success is duty 

because a lot of people thinks that "success will come to me without mine efforts", but in real life it's a wrong view of the reality. 

success is a long way and u should go, work and have a clear plan what u should do on this way. 

there's a lot of difficulties on this way, u will think smth like this "i can't do this", but u must take your fear in your hands and go directly to your aim, not matter how much difficulties u should pass, u must do this.

it sounds very unpleasant and harmful for your mental state, but the success requires sacrifices, it's not an easy walk, it's difficult, it's very difficult, but u must get through it

look up, have a dream, go to the fear and hit that, no matter how it's difficult for you, mistakes make you stronger, do your best, there's not any rest, just hard work, hard work with believe that you will win ...
